<hi id="T1">Titular 1</H1>
	<p>Your hair's under my pillow so I sleep (so I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (Nastylgia) (at my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
I hope a trap boy's your type (why?)
'Cause I don't have a nine-to-five (alright)
I get that your standards high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (literally)
When I write my rhymes, you say you don't like that line, I'll switch it (calm)
You said you don't like my life, you said you don't like my guys
You're trippin', trippin' (you're trippin')
I followed you, I followed you today, I was in my car (alright)
I wanted to come see you from afar (at my feet)
If you turned around and saw me, I would die
When you wipe your tears, do you wipe them just for me?<p>

<hi id="T2">Titular 2</H1>
	<p>How can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day
Somebody tell Doja Cat that I'm tryna indulge in that
In my grey tracksuit, see the bulge in that
See the motion clap when you're throwin' it back (when you're throwin' it back)
These females plannin' on doin' me wrong, so I'm grabbin' a 'dom out the Trojan pack
Post the location after we're gone, can't slip and let them know where we're at
I don't know about you, but I value my life (but I value my life)
'Cause imagine I die (die), and I ain't made a hundred Ms yet
There's so much things I ain't done yet like fuckin' a flight attendant, huh<p>
	
	
	<hi id="T3">Titular 3</H1>
		<p>I don't wanna seem ungrateful God
But I don't wanna be here
I got some things to get off my chest
But maybe it's best I keep it a secret
31st December, the first of Jan
Same shit, I don't care 'bout the new year
New house somewhere that ain't poverty driven
It's mad in the place that I grew in
Yo
Served a pregnant lady, it fucked up my head
Couple things I regret tryna earn a wage
"48 Laws" one book that I read
So if I repent can I turn the page?
Gotta get rid of bad vibes
Anti-clockwise gotta burn the sage, uh
I'll say with it chest but I know some things locked in
I prefer not to say
I fucked up, I'm admittin' it
I got no ego, I got no shame
I swallow my pride and say that I'm missing it
Creep in the changing room at school
And teef from the kids that are privileged, uh
Stolen clothes with a rip in it
Also a stolen phone no SIM in it
Now I got P's I give a lot back
No charity work tryna write off tax
Feds got me on a driving ban
In the passenger seat 'til my license back, uh
Ghost and fly off the map, uh
Try get my mind off rap
I get some sort of survivors guilt
When I see YM's still supplyin' crack
This life don't come with retiring plans
It'll come to an end in unfortunate ways
No such thing as positive thinkin'
When you're locked in, it feel like a maze
Often lose faith and forget to pray
You don't wanna land on the wing with the guys
Why? 'Cause they might melt your face
Cuz got hit with a eight, why?
Why would he care bout some extra days?<p>
